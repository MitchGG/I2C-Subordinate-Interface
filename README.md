# I2C-Subordinate-Interface

## Introduction

This project is an I2C subordinate Read/Write memory device. 
The memory can be instantiated on an FPGA, and be read from or written to with an I2C master device.
This document will explain the design/specification of the subordinate device so that a user may effectively use the device.
